# Web-Development

first update. date-24/9/22
this is my first repo and this contains my progress while learning web development.
i first started learning HTML and CSS. HTML stands for hyper text markup language and it is basically the blue print of a website.
secondly i did CSS. it stands for cascading style sheet. it adds style to the website which include baisc things like colour to advance attributes of the website like animations.
i will be uploading later files as i continue my path towards web development. of course, it will include JS,Django and many more.
